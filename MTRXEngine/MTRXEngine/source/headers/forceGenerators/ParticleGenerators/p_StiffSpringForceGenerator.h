	Description: A very inaccurate implementation of a stiff spring using force averages 
	(This is not accurate and to be used in very limited positions velocity simulation can be incorrect and doesn't take other forces into consideration
	and there is no rest length for the spring and is also to be used on one particle instead of 2)
